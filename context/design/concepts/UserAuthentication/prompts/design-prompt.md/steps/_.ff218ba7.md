# UserAuthentication â€” Design Changes & Issues

This document outlines the evolution of the `UserAuthentication` concept from its initial representations in Assignment 2 (`User` and `EmailAuth`) to its current, consolidated form. It details the reasoning behind these changes, connecting them directly to the feedback received and broader concept design principles.

## Summary of Changes

The primary change is the **consolidation of user account management and email verification functionality** into a single `UserAuthentication` concept.

Key specific changes include:

1. **Merging `User` (authentication aspects) and `EmailAuth`**: The original `User` concept (handling identity, names, and a basic status) and `EmailAuth` concept (handling verification codes) have been combined.
2. **Generic `User` Type**: The concept now accepts a generic `User` type parameter (`[User]`) for user identifiers. It no longer defines specific user attributes like `firstName` and `lastName`, deferring these to other concepts.
3. **Refined Status Model**: The `status` field for `UserAccounts` evolved from `PENDING`, `REGISTERED`, `DEACTIVATED` to `UNVERIFIED`, `VERIFIED`, `DEACTIVATED`. This new model explicitly dictates that only `VERIFIED` users can `login`.
4. **Integrated Email Verification**: All aspects of email verification (code generation, expiry, matching, and account status update) are now internal to `UserAuthentication`. This includes the `VerificationCodes` state and associated actions like `sendVerificationCode`, `verifyCode`, and `revokeVerification`.
5. **Password Hashing**: Explicitly includes `passwordHashed` in the state for security best practices.
6. **Explicit Error Handling**: Actions like `registerUser` and `login` now define separate return signatures for successful outcomes (e.g., `(user: User)`) and explicit error messages for failure (e.g., `(error: String)`).
7. **Reactivation Flow**: A deactivated user reactivates to an `UNVERIFIED` state, requiring re-verification of their email for full account functionality and login.
8. **System Cleanup Action**: Introduction of a `system cleanExpiredCodes` action to manage the transient state of expired verification codes.

## Rationale (Connect to Feedback)

The changes were directly inspired by the Assignment 2 feedback, which highlighted issues with modularity, separation of concerns, and concept independence:

* **"User is a generic type and extremely standard, so in the future no need to define it unless there is really special functionality for your app."**
  * **Response**: The `UserAuthentication` concept now uses a generic `User` type `[User]` to refer to user identities. It no longer includes user-specific attributes like `firstName` or `lastName` (which would typically fall under a `UserProfile` concept). This change aligns `UserAuthentication` with the principle of focusing on "a very small and specific set of info and actions" by strictly limiting its scope to authentication-related user properties (`email`, `passwordHashed`, `status`).
* **"Typically email auth is also not its own concept (remember the token example from the psets?)."**
  * **Response**: The `EmailAuth` concept was merged directly into `UserAuthentication`. The feedback correctly identified that `EmailAuth` was highly coupled to the `User` concept and lacked true independence. Consolidating it ensures `UserAuthentication` is complete in managing its entire authentication lifecycle, including the necessary verification steps, without relying on a separate, dependent concept.
* **"We want to maintain modularity and separation of concerns such that each concept handles only a very small and specific set of info and actions..."**
  * **Response**: By combining the authentication aspects of `User` and the entirety of `EmailAuth`, `UserAuthentication` now represents a single, cohesive, and self-contained unit responsible *solely* for account creation, credential management, and email-based activation/verification. This well-defined boundary effectively separates authentication concerns from other user-related functionalities (e.g., profiles, roles, permissions), which would be handled by distinct concepts. This significantly improves modularity and separation of concerns.

## Design Decisions

1. **Merging `EmailAuth` into `UserAuthentication`**:
   * **Why**: The original `EmailAuth` concept suffered from a lack of concept independence, as its state and actions were inextricably linked to a `User`. Email verification is an integral part of a user account's lifecycle and security status. Merging these aspects creates a single, more coherent concept that fully encapsulates the *authentication* process, from registration to verification and login. This better aligns with the "Completeness of functionality" principle for a specific domain (authentication).
   * **Result**: The `VerificationCodes` state and associated actions (`sendVerificationCode`, `verifyCode`, `revokeVerification`) are now internal to `UserAuthentication`, eliminating problematic cross-concept dependencies for this core flow.

2. **Refined Status Model (`UNVERIFIED`, `VERIFIED`, `DEACTIVATED`)**:
   * **Why**: The `PENDING`/`REGISTERED` distinction in the original `User` concept was ambiguous regarding login eligibility. The new model clearly defines `VERIFIED` as the explicit prerequisite for `login`, providing a more precise and robust state machine for account activation and security. The `DEACTIVATED` state ensures accounts are marked as unusable until explicit reactivation.
   * **Result**: Enhanced clarity in user lifecycle management and improved security (e.g., an unverified user cannot log in).

3. **Use of Generic `User` Type**:
   * **Why**: To prevent `UserAuthentication` from becoming a monolithic "God object" attempting to handle all aspects of a "user." By accepting a generic `User` type parameter, `UserAuthentication` focuses purely on *authenticating* an identity, without conflating it with profile details (e.g., `firstName`, `lastName`) or other attributes. This promotes reusability across diverse applications.
   * **Result**: `UserAuthentication` is more focused, adheres better to separation of concerns, and is more reusable. Other concepts (e.g., `UserProfile`, `UserRoles`) would manage other aspects of a user, using synchronizations to coordinate with `UserAuthentication` as needed.

## Issues Encountered

1. **Status Model Complexity (Trade-off)**: While the `UNVERIFIED`/`VERIFIED` model is clearer for active accounts, the `DEACTIVATED` state introduces complexity regarding reactivation. The current design dictates that reactivating an account returns it to `UNVERIFIED` status, requiring the user to re-verify their email.
   * **Trade-off**: This choice prioritizes security (ensuring email ownership after a potential period of inactivity or compromise) over potential user experience friction (requiring an additional step for reactivation). An alternative design could allow `DEACTIVATED` accounts to return directly to `VERIFIED` if previously verified, but the chosen approach enforces a more robust security posture.

2. **Code Expiry and Cleanup**: The `VerificationCodes` have an `expiry` time, necessitating a `system cleanExpiredCodes` action to manage transient state.
   * **Issue**: While this action is part of the concept, the `system` qualifier implies that an external mechanism (e.g., a background job, cron service, or scheduled task) is required to trigger this cleanup periodically. This isn't strictly an *issue* with the concept's definition but highlights an operational dependency that needs to be considered during application implementation.

3. **Definition of "User" Across Concepts (Ongoing Consideration)**: While `UserAuthentication` now correctly uses a generic `User` type to avoid being a "God object," the overall system still needs a clear understanding of what a "User" represents when aggregating information from different concepts.
   * **Trade-off**: This approach is a *positive* trade-off for modularity and reusability, as it pushes the responsibility of defining rich user attributes (like name, address, preferences) to other specialized concepts (e.g., `UserProfile`, `UserSettings`). However, constructing a full "user profile" view for an application will require careful orchestration and coordination of data from multiple concepts via synchronizations.

These changes collectively enhance the clarity, modularity, and reusability of `UserAuthentication`, making it a more robust and compliant concept design in line with the specified principles.

# UserAuthentication â€” Design Changes & Issues

This document outlines the evolution of the `UserAuthentication` concept from its initial representations in Assignment 2 (`User` and `EmailAuth`) to its current, consolidated form. It details the reasoning behind these changes, connecting them directly to the feedback received and broader concept design principles.

## Summary of Changes

The primary change is the **consolidation of user account management and email verification functionality** into a single `UserAuthentication` concept.

Key specific changes include:

1. **Consolidated Authentication and Verification**: Merged the authentication-related aspects of the original `User` concept with the `EmailAuth` concept.
2. **Generic `User` Type**: Now uses a generic `User` type parameter (`[User]`) for user identifiers, shedding non-authentication-specific attributes.
3. **Refined Status Model**: `UserAccounts` status evolved to `UNVERIFIED`, `VERIFIED`, `DEACTIVATED`, with `VERIFIED` users solely eligible for `login`.
4. **Integrated Email Verification**: All aspects of email verification (code generation, expiry, matching, status update) are now internal, including `VerificationCodes` state and actions.
5. **Password Hashing**: Explicitly includes `passwordHashed` in state for security.
6. **Explicit Error Handling**: Actions define explicit success (`(user: User)`) and error (`(error: String)`) return signatures.
7. **Reactivation Flow**: A deactivated user reactivates to an `UNVERIFIED` state, requiring re-verification.
8. **System Cleanup Action**: Introduced `system cleanExpiredCodes` to manage expired verification codes.

## Explaining Changes, Design Decisions, and Rationale

The design of `UserAuthentication` was significantly refined based on Assignment 2 feedback, focusing on modularity, separation of concerns, and concept independence.

### Consolidation of Authentication Logic (User & EmailAuth)

* **Change**: The authentication-specific responsibilities of the original `User` concept and the entirety of the `EmailAuth` concept were merged into `UserAuthentication`. This concept now internally manages user identity (via a generic `User` type), account credentials, and the full email verification lifecycle. Non-authentication-specific user attributes like `firstName` or `lastName` have been removed.
* **Rationale & Feedback**: This directly addresses the feedback, "Typically email auth is also not its own concept (remember the token example from the psets?)." In Assignment 2's Exercise 2, `PasswordAuthentication` was extended to include token-based email confirmation *within* the same concept. Similarly, `EmailAuth`'s functionality serves as an *internal mechanism* for `UserAuthentication`'s purpose (account verification), rather than a standalone, user-facing concept. Its state (`VerificationCodes`) and actions (`sendVerificationCode`, `verifyCode`) are intrinsically tied to the user account's lifecycle and status. By consolidating, `UserAuthentication` achieves *completeness of functionality* for its domain by encapsulating the entire account lifecycle, from registration to verification and login. This eliminates a problematic cross-concept dependency, improving *concept independence* and ensuring all authentication-related logic resides in one cohesive unit, thereby enhancing *separation of concerns*.

### Generic User Identity & Refined Status Model

* **Change**: `UserAuthentication` now employs a generic `User` type parameter (`[User]`) and features a refined `status` model for `UserAccounts` (`UNVERIFIED`, `VERIFIED`, `DEACTIVATED`).
* **Rationale & Feedback**: This addresses the feedback, "User is a generic type and extremely standard... no need to define it unless there is really special functionality for your app." By using a generic `User` type and removing attributes like `firstName` or `lastName`, `UserAuthentication` strictly focuses on *authenticating* an identity, not defining a comprehensive user profile. This significantly improves its *modularity* and *reusability*. The `UNVERIFIED`/`VERIFIED`/`DEACTIVATED` status model provides a clear, robust state machine, explicitly linking `VERIFIED` status to `login` eligibility, enhancing both clarity and security. Other user attributes are now appropriately deferred to separate, specialized concepts (e.g., `UserProfile`), promoting better *separation of concerns*.

### Enhanced Security and Clarity

* **Changes**: `UserAuthentication` now explicitly includes `passwordHashed` in its state, defines distinct return signatures for success and error in actions like `registerUser` and `login`, implements a reactivation flow that returns accounts to `UNVERIFIED` status, and includes a `system cleanExpiredCodes` action.
* **Rationale**: These additions collectively bolster security practices, provide clearer API contracts for developers, and define a complete, predictable lifecycle for user accounts. The `system cleanExpiredCodes` action specifically manages the transient state of verification codes, contributing to the concept's overall robustness.

## Issues Encountered

1. **Status Model Complexity (Trade-off)**: The `DEACTIVATED` state currently requires reactivation to an `UNVERIFIED` status, necessitating re-verification. This design prioritizes security (re-establishing email ownership after potential inactivity) over user experience friction. An alternative allowing direct return to `VERIFIED` was considered but deemed less secure.
2. **Code Expiry and Cleanup**: The `system cleanExpiredCodes` action, while crucial for managing expired `VerificationCodes`, implies an external operational dependency (e.g., a background job or cron service). This is an implementation detail that needs consideration beyond the concept definition itself.
3. **Definition of "User" Across Concepts (Ongoing Consideration)**: While `UserAuthentication` effectively uses a generic `User` type for modularity, defining a comprehensive "User" experience across an application requires coordinating information from various specialized concepts (e.g., `UserProfile`, `UserSettings`) via synchronizations. This is a positive trade-off for concept independence but necessitates careful orchestration for a complete user view.

These changes collectively enhance the clarity, modularity, and reusability of `UserAuthentication`, making it a more robust and compliant concept design in line with the specified principles.

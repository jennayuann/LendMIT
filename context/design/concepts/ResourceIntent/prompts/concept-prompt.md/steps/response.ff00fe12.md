# response:

Here's an iteration on the `ResourceIntent` concept, referencing the background information and ensuring it aligns with the principles of Concept Design, especially independence and separation of concerns.

The primary change focuses on removing any direct dependency on the `Resource` concept's ownership information from `ResourceIntent`'s internal constraints and action requirements. These authorization rules are externalities to the concept of an *intent* itself and are best handled by `syncs` that orchestrate interactions between `ResourceIntent`, `Resource`, and a `Request` concept.

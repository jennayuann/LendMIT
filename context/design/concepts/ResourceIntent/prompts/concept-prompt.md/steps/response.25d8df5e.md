# response:

Here's an iterated version of the `ResourceIntent` concept, refined to align more closely with the provided concept design principles and example format.

Key changes:

1. **Consistent Formatting:** Aligned with the `Resource` example for concept declaration and optional type annotations (`?`).
2. **State Constraints Refinement:** Removed ownership-related rules from the concept's internal `Constraints` as these are *external preconditions* to actions, typically enforced by synchronization rules, rather than intrinsic state invariants of the `ResourceIntent` concept itself. The uniqueness and time window validity remain as internal constraints.
3. **Action Precondition Clarity:** Retained ownership checks in `requires` clauses, acknowledging that concepts can declare preconditions that rely on external information, which are then enforced by syncs. This is consistent with the `DeletePost` sync example.
4. **Parameter Naming Consistency:** Used `resourceID` and `userID` as parameter names for actions where appropriate.
5. **`switchIntentType` Simplification:** Removed the "optional policy" note regarding clearing fields. The concept's action simply changes the type; any subsequent field modifications would be handled by a separate `updateIntent` call, maintaining strict separation of concerns.

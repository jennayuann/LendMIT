# New Request: Iterate on the above response.

Refine and generalize the refactoring plan with the following adjustments:

1. Replace the `TagSubscription` and `NotificationInbox` concepts with more **general and modular** concepts.
   * The `TagSubscription` design is too narrow; instead, introduce something like a general `Subscription` or `Following` concept that can express interest or relationships between arbitrary entities (not just tags).
   * Similarly, generalize `NotificationInbox` into a broader `Notification` concept that can handle any event-driven alert or update, not bounded to an inbox.

2. Revisit the `ContentItem` concept from the `Posting` refactor.
   * Consider making it even more generic â€” perhaps a reusable `Resource` concept that represents any entity with ownership and attributes (name, category, description, etc.).
   * Clarify how `Resource` could integrate with `TimeBoundedResource` and `ResourceStatus` to form a cohesive modular structure.

Keep the output concise and focused on high-level refactoring plans and conceptual relationships, **not full rewritten specs yet.**

Here are the full concept specifications in 6.1040 structured notation, adhering to the principles of modularity, self-containment, and using only primitive or ID values.

***

## Concept Specifications

### 1. User and EmailAuth Concepts

#### `UserProfile`

**concept** UserProfile \[User]

**purpose** Store mutable, descriptive attributes of a user's profile.

**principle** After a user has been identified (e.g., registered), their personal details such as first name, last name, and an optional bio and image can be updated and retrieved, allowing others to see their public persona.

**state**
  a set of Profiles with
    user User
    firstName String
    lastName String
    bio String?
    thumbnail Image?

**actions**
  updateProfile (user: User, firstName: String, lastName: String, bio: String?, thumbnail: Image?): Empty
    **requires** a Profile entry for `user` exists.
    **effects** Updates the `firstName`, `lastName`, `bio`, and `thumbnail` for the given `user`. If a Profile entry does not exist, a new one is created.

  \_getProfile (user: User): (firstName: String, lastName: String, bio: String?, thumbnail: Image?)
    **requires** a Profile entry for `user` exists.
    **effects** Returns the `firstName`, `lastName`, `bio`, and `thumbnail` associated with the `user`.

***

#### `UserAuthentication`

**concept** UserAuthentication \[User]

**purpose** Manage user credentials (email, password) and core authentication status (registered, deactivated).

**principle** If a user provides a unique email and a password to register, they can subsequently log in with those credentials to be authenticated. If their account is deactivated, they cannot log in until it is reactivated.

**state**
  a set of Credentials with
    user User
    email String
    passwordHashed String
    status of REGISTERED or DEACTIVATED

**actions**
  registerUser (email: String, password: String): (user: User)
    **requires** `email` is unique and not currently associated with any existing Credentials entry.
    **effects** Creates a new `user` ID, associates it with `email`, a hashed version of `password`, and sets `status` to `REGISTERED`. Returns the newly created `user` ID.

  registerUser (email: String, password: String): (error: String)
    **requires** `email` is already associated with an existing Credentials entry.
    **effects** Returns an `error` message indicating the email is already in use.

  login (email: String, password: String): (user: User)
    **requires** An entry exists with `email`, `passwordHashed` matches `password`, and `status` is `REGISTERED`.
    **effects** Returns the `user` ID associated with the matching credentials.

  login (email: String, password: String): (error: String)
    **requires** No entry exists with `email`, or `passwordHashed` does not match `password`, or `status` is `DEACTIVATED`.
    **effects** Returns an `error` message indicating authentication failure.

  changePassword (user: User, newPassword: String): Empty
    **requires** A Credentials entry for `user` exists and `status` is `REGISTERED`.
    **effects** Updates the `passwordHashed` for the given `user` to a hashed version of `newPassword`.

    **effects** Sets the `status` for `user` to `REGISTERED`.

  deactivateUser (user: User): Empty
    **requires** A Credentials entry for `user` exists and `status` is `REGISTERED`.
    **effects** Sets the `status` for `user` to `DEACTIVATED`.

***

#### `EmailVerification`

**concept** EmailVerification \[User]

**purpose** Manage the generation, delivery, and validation of email verification codes for users.

**principle** If a user requests an email verification code, a new code is generated and stored with an expiration time; if the user provides the correct code before it expires, their request is marked as verified.

**state**
  a set of VerificationRequests with
    user User
    email String
    code String
    expiry DateTime
    verified Flag = false

**actions**
  sendVerificationCode (user: User, email: String): Empty
    **requires** No active (unexpired and unverified) VerificationRequest exists for `user`.
    **effects** Creates a new `VerificationRequest` for `user` with the given `email`, a newly generated `code`, and an `expiry` time (e.g., 15 minutes from `currentTime`).

  verifyCode (user: User, code: String): (verified: Boolean)
    **requires** An active (unexpired and unverified) VerificationRequest exists for `user` with a matching `code`.
    **effects** If the `requires` condition is met, sets `verified = true` for the matching `VerificationRequest` and returns `true`. Otherwise, returns `false`.

  revokeVerification (user: User): Empty
    **requires** One or more VerificationRequest entries exist for `user`.
    **effects** Deletes all VerificationRequest entries associated with `user`.

  system cleanExpiredVerifications (): Empty
    **requires** There are VerificationRequest entries where `currentTime >= expiry` and `verified` is `false`.
    **effects** Deletes all VerificationRequest entries that have expired and are not yet verified.

***

### 2. Posting Concept (Generalized)

#### `Resource`

**concept** Resource \[ResourceID, Owner]

**purpose** Represent any generic entity or item that can be owned and described by basic attributes.

**principle** An owner can create a named resource, which is then uniquely identified and its descriptive attributes can be retrieved or modified.

**state**
  a set of GenericResources with
    id ResourceID
    owner Owner
    name String
    category String?
    description String?

    **requires** `name` is not an empty string.
    **effects** Creates a new `GenericResource` entry with a unique `id`, the specified `owner`, `name`, `category`, and `description`. Returns the `id` of the newly created resource.

  createResource (owner: Owner, name: String, category: String?, description: String?): (error: String)
    **requires** `name` is an empty string.
    **effects** Returns an `error` message indicating the name cannot be empty.

    **requires** A `GenericResource` entry with `id = resourceID` exists.
    **effects** Returns the `owner`, `name`, `category`, and `description` of the `GenericResource`.

***

#### `TimeBoundedResource`

**concept** TimeBoundedResource \[ResourceID]

**purpose** Manage time-based availability and expiration windows for any generic resource.

**principle** If a specific availability window (from a start time to an end time) is defined for a resource, then the concept can determine if the resource is currently available, and a system action can be triggered once the resource's window has closed.

**state**
  a set of TimeWindows with
    resource ResourceID
    availableFrom DateTime
    availableUntil DateTime

**actions**
  defineTimeWindow (resource: ResourceID, availableFrom: DateTime, availableUntil: DateTime): Empty
    **requires** `availableFrom` is earlier than `availableUntil`.
    **effects** Creates or updates the `TimeWindow` for the given `resource` with the specified `availableFrom` and `availableUntil` times.

  system expireResource (resource: ResourceID): Empty
    **requires** A `TimeWindow` entry exists for `resource` where `currentTime >= availableUntil`.
    **effects** This action serves as an event notification. It changes no state within this concept, but its occurrence signals to other concepts (via synchronization) that the resource's time window has ended.

***

#### `ResourceStatus`

**concept** ResourceStatus \[ResourceID]

**purpose** Manage explicit lifecycle statuses for a generic resource, allowing it to transition through predefined stages.

**principle** A resource can be marked with a specific status (e.g., active, fulfilled, cancelled, expired), and its current status can be queried, enabling external logic to react to its lifecycle stage.

**state**
  a set of StatusEntries with
    resource ResourceID
    status of ACTIVE or FULFILLED or CANCELLED or EXPIRED

**actions**
  markActive (resource: ResourceID): Empty
    **requires** A `StatusEntry` for `resource` does not exist, or its current `status` is not `ACTIVE`.
    **effects** Sets the `status` for `resource` to `ACTIVE`. If no entry exists, a new one is created.

  markFulfilled (resource: ResourceID): Empty
    **requires** A `StatusEntry` for `resource` exists and its `status` is not `CANCELLED` or `FULFILLED`.
    **effects** Sets the `status` for `resource` to `FULFILLED`.

  markCancelled (resource: ResourceID): Empty
    **requires** A `StatusEntry` for `resource` exists and its `status` is not `FULFILLED` or `CANCELLED`.
    **effects** Sets the `status` for `resource` to `CANCELLED`.

  markExpired (resource: ResourceID): Empty
    **requires** A `StatusEntry` for `resource` exists and its `status` is `ACTIVE`.
    **effects** Sets the `status` for `resource` to `EXPIRED`.

  \_getStatus (resource: ResourceID): (status: String)
    **requires** A `StatusEntry` for `resource` exists.
    **effects** Returns the current `status` of the `resource`.

***

**concept** Following \[Follower, Followee]

**purpose** Establish and manage a unidirectional "following" relationship between any two generic entities.

**principle** A follower can choose to initiate a following relationship with a followee, and later terminate it, with the relationship's existence accurately reflected in the system.

**state**
  a set of FollowRelationships with
    follower Follower
    followee Followee

**actions**
  follow (follower: Follower, followee: Followee): Empty
    **requires** No `FollowRelationship` already exists where `follower` follows `followee`.
    **effects** Creates a new `FollowRelationship` entry for `follower` and `followee`.

  unfollow (follower: Follower, followee: Followee): Empty
    **requires** A `FollowRelationship` exists where `follower` follows `followee`.
    **effects** Deletes the `FollowRelationship` entry for `follower` and `followee`.

  \_isFollowing (follower: Follower, followee: Followee): (isFollowing: Boolean)
    **requires** `true`.
    **effects** Returns `true` if a `FollowRelationship` exists where `follower` follows `followee`, `false` otherwise.

***

#### `NotificationLog`

**concept** NotificationLog \[Recipient, NotificationID]

**purpose** Log, manage, and track the status of generic event-driven alerts or messages for recipients.

**principle** When an important event occurs, a generic notification is logged for a recipient, recording its payload and timestamp; it can then be marked as delivered and later dismissed by the recipient.

**state**
  a set of Notifications with
    id NotificationID
    recipient Recipient
    payload JSON
    sentAt DateTime
    deliveredFlag Boolean = false
    dismissedAt DateTime?

**actions**
  logNotification (recipient: Recipient, payload: JSON): (notificationID: NotificationID)
    **requires** `payload` is a well-formed JSON string.
    **effects** Creates a new `Notification` entry with a unique `id`, the `recipient`, the `payload` as a string, `sentAt = currentTime`, and `deliveredFlag = false`. Returns the `id` of the new notification.

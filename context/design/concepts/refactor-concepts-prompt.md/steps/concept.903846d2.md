# concept: TimeBoundedResource

* **concept**: TimeBoundedResource \[ResourceID]
* **purpose**: Manage time-based availability and expiration windows for any generic resource.
* **principle**: If a specific availability window (from a start time to an end time) is defined for a resource, then the concept can determine if the resource is currently available, and a system action can be triggered once the resource's window has closed.
* **state**:
  * a set of `TimeWindows` with
    * `resource` ResourceID
    * `availableFrom` DateTime
    * `availableUntil` DateTime
* **actions**:
  * `defineTimeWindow (resource: ResourceID, availableFrom: DateTime, availableUntil: DateTime): Empty`
    * **requires**: `availableFrom` is earlier than `availableUntil`.
    * **effects**: Creates or updates the `TimeWindow` for the given `resource` with the specified `availableFrom` and `availableUntil` times.
  * `system expireResource (resource: ResourceID): Empty`
    * **requires**: A `TimeWindow` entry exists for `resource` where `currentTime >= availableUntil`.
    * **effects**: This action serves as an event notification. It changes no state within this concept, but its occurrence signals to other concepts (via synchronization) that the resource's time window has ended.

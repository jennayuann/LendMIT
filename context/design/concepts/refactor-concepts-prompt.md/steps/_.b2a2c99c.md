# Request for Concept Refactoring Guidance

Please read my Assignment 2 feedback and the four current concept specifications.\
Then suggest, in detail:

* Which concepts need refactoring or merging/splitting
* Where independence or modularity rules are violated
* How to simplify or clarify actions, state, and queries
* How to better name my concepts, states, and actions
* How to restructure arguments to use primitive or ID values

Output a concise plan of recommended refactorings, **not full rewritten specs yet**.

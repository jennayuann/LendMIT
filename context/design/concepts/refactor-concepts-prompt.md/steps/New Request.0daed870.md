# New Request: Generate the concepts.

Please generate full concept specifications (in 6.1040 structured notation) for all the concepts described above.

Each concept should include:

* purpose
* principle
* state
* actions (with requires/effects clauses)
* and brief, clear naming consistent with 6.1040 spec style.

Make sure each concept is self-contained and modular, using only primitive or ID values (no cross-concept dependencies).

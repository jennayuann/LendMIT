# Request for Iteration: Refine `UserProfile` for Modularity and Reuse

Review the current `UserProfile` concept and iterate on it with an emphasis on **modularity** and **separation of concerns**.

Goals:

1. Refactor so that `UserProfile` represents only *profile attributes* â€” not anything else.
2. Ensure the concept can be reused in many contexts without any dependency on specific user systems.
3. Simplify the **principle** and **state** to describe only what this concept controls.
4. Consider whether the actions set is complete.
5. Revise wording to make it *conceptually independent* of other unrelated systems.

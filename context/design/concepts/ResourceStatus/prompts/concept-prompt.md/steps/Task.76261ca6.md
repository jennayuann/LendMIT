# Task: Iterate on the ResourceStatus concept.

* Reference the background I provided above, ensuring the concept matches the rubric.
* Replace the hard-coded status values (`ACTIVE`, `FULFILLED`, `CANCELLED`, `EXPIRED`) with a more flexible structure that can represent arbitrary, application-defined states while still enforcing consistent transitions between them.
* Add in a create function so that we can create StatusEntries without having to call mark because that is unnatural.

# response:

To properly test the `Following` concept, we'll create a Deno test file `src/Following/FollowingConcept.test.ts`. Since the concept implementation is not provided, I will include a mock implementation that uses Deno's built-in KV store to simulate the actions and state described by the concept. In a real project, these functions would be imported from the actual concept implementation file (e.g., `src/Following/FollowingConcept.ts`).

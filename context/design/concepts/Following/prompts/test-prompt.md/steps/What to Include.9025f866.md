# What to Include:

1. Unit tests for every action.
   * Happy-path tests: confirm that actions work correctly when all requires are met.
   * Requires violation tests: confirm that appropriate errors are thrown when preconditions are not met.
   * Edge case tests: explore boundaries of valid inputs (e.g., empty strings, same IDs, missing optional fields, invalid JSON, etc.).
   * Idempotency checks: ensure repeated valid actions behave consistently.
   * State verification: confirm the MongoDB collection reflects correct changes after each operation.

2. Trace test (Principle verification).
   * Write one “trace” test that simulates a realistic multi-step interaction showing how the actions collectively fulfill the concept’s principle.

3. Robustness tests.
   * Add cases for edge cases, unexpected sequences, or concurrency-like scenarios.
   * Validate cleanup and data consistency after failed operations.

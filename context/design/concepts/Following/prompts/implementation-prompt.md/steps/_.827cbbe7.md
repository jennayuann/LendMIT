# Implement the following concept in TypeScript using the Deno platform, following the provided concept specifications.

The concept should be implemented as a class named after the concept (e.g., `UserProfile`, `ResourceStatus`), stored in `src/concepts/<conceptName>.ts`.

Each method in the class should correspond to one action in the specification.\
Each method must:

* Enforce all "requires" conditions and throw a descriptive `Error` when violated.
* Perform the described "effects" accurately using MongoDB operations.
* Return values exactly as specified (e.g., IDs, objects, lists).
* Use async/await for all database interactions.

Implementation requirements:

1. Use the existing MongoDB connection in `db/connection.ts`, which exports `db` (connection.ts given below).
2. The MongoDB collection name should be the plural form of the concept (e.g., `resources`, `profiles`, `notifications`).
3. Use idiomatic TypeScript types and interfaces to represent the conceptâ€™s state (e.g., interfaces for each entity).
4. Throw clear, specific errors when "requires" conditions are not met.
5. Avoid any hard-coded database connection logic; import `db` from `@/db/connection.ts`.
6. At the bottom of the file, export the instantiated class (e.g., `export const userProfile = new UserProfile();`).

You have access to (all given below):

* The concept specification for this concept.
* The MongoDB connection file located at `src/db/connection.ts` and given below, which exports `db`.
* A guide on how to implement concepts.

Generate the implementation file content for this concept.

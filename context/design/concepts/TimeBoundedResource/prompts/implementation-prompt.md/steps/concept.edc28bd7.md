# concept: TimeBoundedResource

* **concept**: TimeBoundedResource \[ResourceID]
* **purpose**: Manage time-based availability and expiration windows for any generic resource.
* **principle**: This concept defines and tracks availability windows for resources with optional start and end times, corresponding to starting now and available indefinitely respectively. It can report a resource's current window and signals when a resource's availability has ended.
* **state**:
  * a set of `TimeWindow` entries, each consisting of:
    * `resource`: ResourceID
    * `availableFrom`: DateTime? (null implies available starting now)
    * `availableUntil`: DateTime? (null implies indefinitely available into the future)
* **actions**:
  * `defineTimeWindow (resource: ResourceID, availableFrom: DateTime?, availableUntil: DateTime?): Empty`
    * **requires**:
      * If both `availableFrom` and `availableUntil` are provided (non-null), then `availableFrom` must be strictly earlier than `availableUntil`.
    * **effects**: Creates a new `TimeWindow` entry for the given `resource` or updates an existing one with the specified availability bounds. If `availableFrom` is not provided, then it's available starting now. If `availableUntil` is not provided, then it's available indefinitely.
  * `getTimeWindow (resource: ResourceID): TimeWindow?`
    * **effects**: Returns the `TimeWindow` entry for the specified `resource`, containing its `resource` ID, `availableFrom`, and `availableUntil` times. Returns `null` if no time window is defined for the resource.
  * `expireResource (resource: ResourceID): Empty`
    * **requires**:
      * A `TimeWindow` entry exists for `resource`.
      * The `availableUntil` for that `resource` is defined (non-null).
      * The `currentTime` (the moment this action is triggered) is greater than or equal to the `availableUntil` value for the `resource`.
    * **effects**: This action serves as an event notification. It explicitly changes no state within this concept. Its occurrence signals to other concepts (via synchronization) that the resource's time-bound availability (as defined by its `availableUntil` property) has ended.

## db/connection.ts:

```
// src/db/connection.ts

// deno-lint-ignore no-import-prefix

import { MongoClient } from "npm:mongodb";

// deno-lint-ignore no-import-prefix

import "jsr:@std/dotenv/load";

  

const MONGODB_URL = Deno.env.get("MONGODB_URL");

const DB_NAME = Deno.env.get("DB_NAME");

  

if (!MONGODB_URL || !DB_NAME) {

throw new Error("Missing MONGODB_URL or DB_NAME in environment variables");

}

  

const client = new MongoClient(MONGODB_URL);

  

// Connect once and export the database

await client.connect(); // ✅ Establish connection once

console.log(`✅ Connected to MongoDB database: ${DB_NAME}`);

  

export const db = client.db(DB_NAME);
```

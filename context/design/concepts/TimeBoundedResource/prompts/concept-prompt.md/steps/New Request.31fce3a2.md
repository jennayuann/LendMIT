# New Request: Iterate on the above response

* Take out the parenthesis explaining the state, except for availableFrom (say null is available starting now) and availableUntil (null is available indefinitely)
* Use ? to signify optional, such as DateTime?
* The requires of definineTimeWindow is missing an important check that all DateTimes provided must be in the future or now.
* Just have getTimeWindow return the timeWindow: TimeWindow object in question.

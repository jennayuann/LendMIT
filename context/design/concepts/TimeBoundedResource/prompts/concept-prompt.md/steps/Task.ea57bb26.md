# Task: Iterate on the TimeBoundedResource concept.

* Reference the background I provided above, ensuring the concept matches the rubric.
* Make the concept more general: handle optional availability bounds. Right now, you require *both* `availableFrom` and `availableUntil`. You could allow either one (e.g., “available starting now until indefinite” or “was available until X”).  That makes it useful for resources that have open-ended availability.
* Adding a simple `getTimeWindow(resource)` helps maintain symmetry and supports lookup by other concepts.
* Take out the system in expireResource.

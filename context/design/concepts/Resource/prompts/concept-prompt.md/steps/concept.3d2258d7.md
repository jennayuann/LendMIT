# concept: Resource

* **concept**: Resource \[ResourceID, Owner]
* **purpose**: Represent any generic entity that can be owned and described by basic attributes.
* **principle**: An owner can create a resource, which is then uniquely identified and its descriptive attributes can be retrieved or modified.
* **state**:
  * a set of `Resources` with
    * `id` ResourceID
    * `owner` Owner
    * `name` String?
    * `category` String?
    * `description` String?
* **actions**:
  * `createResource (owner: Owner, name: String?, category: String?, description: String?): (resourceID: ResourceID)`
    * **requires**: None.
    * **effects**: Creates a new `Resource` entry with a unique `id`, the specified `owner`, `name`, `category`, and `description`. Returns the `id` of the newly created resource.
  * `updateResource (resourceID: ResourceID, name: String?, category: String?, description: String?): Empty`
    * **requires**: A `Resource` entry with `id = resourceID` exists.
    * **effects**: Updates the `name`, `category`, and/or `description` for the given `resourceID` with the provided non-null values. If a `name`, `category`, or `description` is provided as `null`, it clears the existing value for that attribute.
  * `deleteResource (resourceID: ResourceID): Empty`
    * **requires**: A `Resource` entry with `id = resourceID` exists.
    * **effects**: Deletes the `Resource` entry corresponding to `resourceID`.
  * `_getResource (resourceID: ResourceID): (owner: Owner, name: String?, category: String?, description: String?)`
    * **requires**: A `Resource` entry with `id = resourceID` exists.
    * **effects**: Returns the `owner`, `name`, `category`, and `description` of the `Resource`.

**Summary of Changes and Justification based on Concept Design Principles:**

1. **State `Resources` vs. `GenericResources`**: Changed `GenericResources` to `Resources` as requested, keeping the naming concise and direct.
2. **Optional `name` field**:
   * Modified the `name` attribute in the `state` from `String` to `String?` (optional).
   * Removed the two distinct `createResource` actions and consolidated them into one: `createResource (owner: Owner, name: String?, category: String?, description: String?): (resourceID: ResourceID)`. This aligns with the principle of "atomic actions" â€“ an action either succeeds or fails based on its `requires` clauses, and does not return different types (like `error: String`) for different valid inputs. The concept of an empty name is now simply an optional value, not an error condition.
   * Removed the `requires: name is not an empty string` from `createResource`.
3. **Optional Descriptive Fields (`name`, `category`, `description`)**: All descriptive fields in the `state` are now `String?` (optional). This makes the `Resource` concept truly generic, as not all entities require a name, category, or description to exist.
4. **`updateResource` clarity**: Clarified the effects to state that providing `null` for an optional field will clear its existing value, providing complete control over these attributes.
5. **`_getResource` return type**: Updated the return type of `_getResource` to reflect that `name` (along with `category` and `description`) is now optional (`String?`).
6. **Concept Design Rubric Adherence**:
   * **Purpose & Principle**: Updated to reflect that `name` is no longer mandatory.
   * **State Richness**: The state is sufficient to track ownership and basic descriptive properties, but no richer than needed.
   * **Atomic Actions**: Actions are now atomic, with clear `requires` and `effects`. The `createResource` logic is streamlined.
   * **Independence & Polymorphism**: `Owner` and `ResourceID` remain abstract types, reinforcing that this concept doesn't depend on specific implementations of users or other entity types. It's truly independent and reusable.
   * **Separation of Concerns & Completeness**: The `Resource` concept remains focused solely on creating, owning, describing, updating, and deleting generic entities. It doesn't incorporate concerns like authentication, detailed authorization beyond basic ownership, or complex workflows, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and completeness of its own functionality.

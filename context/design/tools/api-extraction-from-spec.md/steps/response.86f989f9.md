# response:

I cannot access external file paths like `../concepts/Following/Following.md`, `../concepts/NotificationLog/NotificationLog.md`, etc. Therefore, I cannot generate API documentation for the concepts listed at the end of your prompt, as their full specifications are not provided within the prompt itself.

However, the `Counter` concept is fully specified within your provided instructions. I will generate the API documentation for the `Counter` concept as an example of what can be done with a complete concept specification.

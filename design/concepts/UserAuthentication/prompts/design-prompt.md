## Original User Concept from Assignment 2
### Concept: User

```

concept User

purpose: provides an identity for each participant in the system so that actions can be tied to real people.

principle: a user begins by registering with their email, name, and password; the user goes into a PENDING status until they verify their email, after which they become a REGISTERED user; users can later deactivate their accounts.

  

state

a set of Users with

an email String

a firstName String

a lastName String

a password String

a status of PENDING OR REGISTERED or DEACTIVATED

  

actions

registerUser(email: String, password: String, firstName: String, lastName: String)

requires: no existing User with this email

effect: a new User is created with the given email, password, firstName, lastName, and status = PENDING

  

changePassword(user: User, newPassword: String)

requires: given user's status is REGISTERED

effect: user's password becomes newPassword

  

activateUser(user: User)

requires: given user's status is PENDING

effect: user's status becomes REGISTERED

  

deactivateUser(user: User)

requires: given user's status is REGISTERED

effect: user's status becomes DEACTIVATED

  

Note: in our case, an MIT email is needed to verify that they're a student.

```
## Original EmailAuth Concept from Assignment 2
### Concept: EmailAuth

```

concept EmailAuth[User, Time]

purpose: verifies ownership of an email address.

principle: the system generates a verification code and delivers it to the email address provided; the person must present that code before the verification expires in order to prove ownership.

  

state

a set of EmailAuth with

a user User

a code String

an expiry Time

a verified Flag

  

actions

sendVerificationCode(user: User)

effects: a new EmailAuth is created for user with a fresh code, expiry in the future, and verified = FALSE

  

verifyCode(user: User, code: String)

requries: an EmailAuth exists for user whose code matches and whose expiry is in the future

effect: that EmailAuth becomes verified = TRUE

  

revokeVerification(user: User)

requries: an EmailAuth exists for user

effect: that EmailAuth record is removed

```

# UserAuthentication — Design Changes & Issues

This document outlines the evolution of the `UserAuthentication` concept from its initial representations in Assignment 2 (`User` and `EmailAuth`) to its current, consolidated form. It details the reasoning behind these changes, connecting them directly to the feedback received and broader concept design principles.

## Summary of Changes

The primary change is the **consolidation of user account management and email verification functionality** into a single `UserAuthentication` concept.

Key specific changes include:

1.  **Merging `User` and `EmailAuth`**: The original `User` concept (handling identity, names, status) and `EmailAuth` concept (handling verification codes) have been combined.
2.  **Generic `User` Type**: The concept now accepts a generic `User` type parameter (`[User]`) for user identifiers, rather than defining internal user-specific attributes like `firstName` and `lastName`.
3.  **Refined Status Model**: The `status` field for `UserAccounts` evolved from `PENDING`, `REGISTERED`, `DEACTIVATED` to `UNVERIFIED`, `VERIFIED`, `DEACTIVATED`, with explicit rules for `login` only for `VERIFIED` users.
4.  **Integrated Email Verification**: All aspects of email verification (code generation, expiry, matching, and status update) are now internal to `UserAuthentication`, including `VerificationCodes` as part of its state and corresponding actions.
5.  **Password Hashing**: Explicit mention of `passwordHashed` in the state for security.
6.  **Explicit Error Handling**: Actions like `registerUser` and `login` now define separate return signatures for success (e.g., `(user: User)`) and failure (e.g., `(error: String)`).
7.  **Reactivation Flow**: A deactivated user reactivates to an `UNVERIFIED` state, requiring re-verification.
8.  **System Cleanup Action**: Introduction of `system cleanExpiredCodes` for managing transient state.

## Rationale (Connect to Feedback)

The changes were directly inspired by the Assignment 2 feedback, which highlighted issues with modularity, separation of concerns, and concept independence:

*   **"User is a generic type and extremely standard, so in the future no need to define it unless there is really special functionality for your app."**
    *   **Response**: The `UserAuthentication` concept now uses a generic `User` type `[User]` to refer to user identities. It no longer attempts to define `firstName` or `lastName` (which would fall under a `UserProfile` concept) but focuses solely on authentication-related user properties (`email`, `passwordHashed`, `status`). This aligns `UserAuthentication` with the principle of focusing on "a very small and specific set of info and actions."
*   **"Typically email auth is also not its own concept (remember the token example from the psets?)."**
    *   **Response**: The `EmailAuth` concept was merged directly into `UserAuthentication`. This eliminates a separate, highly coupled concept and ensures `UserAuthentication` is complete in managing its entire lifecycle, including verification.
*   **"We want to maintain modularity and separation of concerns such that each concept handles only a very small and specific set of info and actions..."**
    *   **Response**: By combining `User` (specifically its authentication aspects) and `EmailAuth`, `UserAuthentication` now represents a cohesive, self-contained unit responsible *solely* for account creation, credential management, and email-based activation/verification. It has a well-defined boundary, distinguishing it from other user-related concerns like profiles, roles, or permissions, which would be handled by separate concepts. This significantly improves separation of concerns.

## Design Decisions

1.  **Merging `EmailAuth` into `UserAuthentication`**:
    *   **Why**: The original `EmailAuth` concept suffered from a lack of concept independence, as it explicitly referenced `User` in its state. Email verification is also intrinsically tied to the lifecycle and security status of a user account. Merging these two aspects creates a single, more coherent concept that fully encapsulates the *authentication* process, from registration to verification and login. This better aligns with the "Completeness of functionality" principle for a specific domain (authentication).
    *   **Result**: The `VerificationCodes` state and associated actions (`sendVerificationCode`, `verifyCode`, `revokeVerification`) are now internal to `UserAuthentication`, eliminating cross-concept dependencies for this core flow.

2.  **Refined Status Model (`UNVERIFIED`, `VERIFIED`, `DEACTIVATED`)**:
    *   **Why**: The `PENDING`/`REGISTERED` distinction in the original `User` concept was less precise regarding login eligibility. The new model clearly defines `VERIFIED` as the prerequisite for `login`, providing a clearer state machine for account activation. The `DEACTIVATED` state ensures accounts are marked as unusable until explicit reactivation.
    *   **Result**: Enhanced clarity in user lifecycle management and security (e.g., an unverified user cannot log in).

3.  **Use of Generic `User` Type**:
    *   **Why**: To prevent `UserAuthentication` from becoming a monolithic "God object" for all things "user". By using a generic `User` type, `UserAuthentication` focuses purely on *authenticating* an identity, without conflating it with profile details (e.g., `firstName`, `lastName`) or other attributes.
    *   **Result**: `UserAuthentication` is more reusable and adheres better to separation of concerns. Other concepts (e.g., `UserProfile`, `UserRoles`) would manage other aspects of a user, using syncs to coordinate with `UserAuthentication` as needed.

## Issues Encountered

1.  **Status Model Complexity (Trade-off)**: While the `UNVERIFIED`/`VERIFIED` model is clearer, the `DEACTIVATED` state adds a layer of complexity to reactivation. Specifically, reactivating an account returns it to `UNVERIFIED` status, requiring the user to re-verify their email.
    *   **Trade-off**: This choice prioritizes security (ensuring email ownership after a period of inactivity) over potential user experience friction (requiring an additional step for reactivation). A design choice could have been to allow `DEACTIVATED` to return to `VERIFIED` if the email was previously verified, but the current approach enforces a more robust security posture.

2.  **Code Expiry and Cleanup**: The `VerificationCodes` have an `expiry` time, necessitating a `system cleanExpiredCodes` action.
    *   **Issue**: While part of the concept, the `system` action implies an external mechanism (e.g., a background job or cron service) to trigger this cleanup. This isn't strictly an *issue* with the concept definition itself but highlights an operational dependency that needs to be considered during implementation.

3.  **Definition of "User" (Ongoing Consideration)**: While `UserAuthentication` now uses a generic `User` type, the overall system still needs a clear understanding of what a "User" is across different concepts.
    *   **Trade-off**: The current approach pushes the responsibility of defining rich user attributes (like name, address, preferences) to other specialized concepts (e.g., `UserProfile`, `UserSettings`). This is a *positive* trade-off for modularity but means a full "user profile" view for an application would require coordinating multiple concepts via syncs.

These changes collectively enhance the clarity, modularity, and reusability of `UserAuthentication`, making it a more robust and compliant concept design.

# UserAuthentication — Design Changes & Issues

This document outlines the evolution of the `UserAuthentication` concept from its initial representations in Assignment 2 (`User` and `EmailAuth`) to its current, consolidated form. It details the reasoning behind these changes, connecting them directly to the feedback received and broader concept design principles.

## Summary of Changes

The primary change is the **consolidation of user account management and email verification functionality** into a single `UserAuthentication` concept.

Key specific changes include:

1.  **Merging `User` (authentication aspects) and `EmailAuth`**: The original `User` concept (handling identity, names, and a basic status) and `EmailAuth` concept (handling verification codes) have been combined.
2.  **Generic `User` Type**: The concept now accepts a generic `User` type parameter (`[User]`) for user identifiers. It no longer defines specific user attributes like `firstName` and `lastName`, deferring these to other concepts.
3.  **Refined Status Model**: The `status` field for `UserAccounts` evolved from `PENDING`, `REGISTERED`, `DEACTIVATED` to `UNVERIFIED`, `VERIFIED`, `DEACTIVATED`. This new model explicitly dictates that only `VERIFIED` users can `login`.
4.  **Integrated Email Verification**: All aspects of email verification (code generation, expiry, matching, and account status update) are now internal to `UserAuthentication`. This includes the `VerificationCodes` state and associated actions like `sendVerificationCode`, `verifyCode`, and `revokeVerification`.
5.  **Password Hashing**: Explicitly includes `passwordHashed` in the state for security best practices.
6.  **Explicit Error Handling**: Actions like `registerUser` and `login` now define separate return signatures for successful outcomes (e.g., `(user: User)`) and explicit error messages for failure (e.g., `(error: String)`).
7.  **Reactivation Flow**: A deactivated user reactivates to an `UNVERIFIED` state, requiring re-verification of their email for full account functionality and login.
8.  **System Cleanup Action**: Introduction of a `system cleanExpiredCodes` action to manage the transient state of expired verification codes.

## Rationale (Connect to Feedback)

The changes were directly inspired by the Assignment 2 feedback, which highlighted issues with modularity, separation of concerns, and concept independence:

*   **"User is a generic type and extremely standard, so in the future no need to define it unless there is really special functionality for your app."**
    *   **Response**: The `UserAuthentication` concept now uses a generic `User` type `[User]` to refer to user identities. It no longer includes user-specific attributes like `firstName` or `lastName` (which would typically fall under a `UserProfile` concept). This change aligns `UserAuthentication` with the principle of focusing on "a very small and specific set of info and actions" by strictly limiting its scope to authentication-related user properties (`email`, `passwordHashed`, `status`).
*   **"Typically email auth is also not its own concept (remember the token example from the psets?)."**
    *   **Response**: The `EmailAuth` concept was merged directly into `UserAuthentication`. The feedback correctly identified that `EmailAuth` was highly coupled to the `User` concept and lacked true independence. Consolidating it ensures `UserAuthentication` is complete in managing its entire authentication lifecycle, including the necessary verification steps, without relying on a separate, dependent concept.
*   **"We want to maintain modularity and separation of concerns such that each concept handles only a very small and specific set of info and actions..."**
    *   **Response**: By combining the authentication aspects of `User` and the entirety of `EmailAuth`, `UserAuthentication` now represents a single, cohesive, and self-contained unit responsible *solely* for account creation, credential management, and email-based activation/verification. This well-defined boundary effectively separates authentication concerns from other user-related functionalities (e.g., profiles, roles, permissions), which would be handled by distinct concepts. This significantly improves modularity and separation of concerns.

## Design Decisions

1.  **Merging `EmailAuth` into `UserAuthentication`**:
    *   **Why**: The original `EmailAuth` concept suffered from a lack of concept independence, as its state and actions were inextricably linked to a `User`. Email verification is an integral part of a user account's lifecycle and security status. Merging these aspects creates a single, more coherent concept that fully encapsulates the *authentication* process, from registration to verification and login. This better aligns with the "Completeness of functionality" principle for a specific domain (authentication).
    *   **Result**: The `VerificationCodes` state and associated actions (`sendVerificationCode`, `verifyCode`, `revokeVerification`) are now internal to `UserAuthentication`, eliminating problematic cross-concept dependencies for this core flow.

2.  **Refined Status Model (`UNVERIFIED`, `VERIFIED`, `DEACTIVATED`)**:
    *   **Why**: The `PENDING`/`REGISTERED` distinction in the original `User` concept was ambiguous regarding login eligibility. The new model clearly defines `VERIFIED` as the explicit prerequisite for `login`, providing a more precise and robust state machine for account activation and security. The `DEACTIVATED` state ensures accounts are marked as unusable until explicit reactivation.
    *   **Result**: Enhanced clarity in user lifecycle management and improved security (e.g., an unverified user cannot log in).

3.  **Use of Generic `User` Type**:
    *   **Why**: To prevent `UserAuthentication` from becoming a monolithic "God object" attempting to handle all aspects of a "user." By accepting a generic `User` type parameter, `UserAuthentication` focuses purely on *authenticating* an identity, without conflating it with profile details (e.g., `firstName`, `lastName`) or other attributes. This promotes reusability across diverse applications.
    *   **Result**: `UserAuthentication` is more focused, adheres better to separation of concerns, and is more reusable. Other concepts (e.g., `UserProfile`, `UserRoles`) would manage other aspects of a user, using synchronizations to coordinate with `UserAuthentication` as needed.

## Issues Encountered

1.  **Status Model Complexity (Trade-off)**: While the `UNVERIFIED`/`VERIFIED` model is clearer for active accounts, the `DEACTIVATED` state introduces complexity regarding reactivation. The current design dictates that reactivating an account returns it to `UNVERIFIED` status, requiring the user to re-verify their email.
    *   **Trade-off**: This choice prioritizes security (ensuring email ownership after a potential period of inactivity or compromise) over potential user experience friction (requiring an additional step for reactivation). An alternative design could allow `DEACTIVATED` accounts to return directly to `VERIFIED` if previously verified, but the chosen approach enforces a more robust security posture.

2.  **Code Expiry and Cleanup**: The `VerificationCodes` have an `expiry` time, necessitating a `system cleanExpiredCodes` action to manage transient state.
    *   **Issue**: While this action is part of the concept, the `system` qualifier implies that an external mechanism (e.g., a background job, cron service, or scheduled task) is required to trigger this cleanup periodically. This isn't strictly an *issue* with the concept's definition but highlights an operational dependency that needs to be considered during application implementation.

3.  **Definition of "User" Across Concepts (Ongoing Consideration)**: While `UserAuthentication` now correctly uses a generic `User` type to avoid being a "God object," the overall system still needs a clear understanding of what a "User" represents when aggregating information from different concepts.
    *   **Trade-off**: This approach is a *positive* trade-off for modularity and reusability, as it pushes the responsibility of defining rich user attributes (like name, address, preferences) to other specialized concepts (e.g., `UserProfile`, `UserSettings`). However, constructing a full "user profile" view for an application will require careful orchestration and coordination of data from multiple concepts via synchronizations.

These changes collectively enhance the clarity, modularity, and reusability of `UserAuthentication`, making it a more robust and compliant concept design in line with the specified principles.

# New Request: Iterate on above response.
Currently, there is a lot of repetition, be more concise. Also, expand on the following, tying in the token example from the psets (context given below):
   **"Typically email auth is also not its own concept (remember the token example from the psets?)."**
    *   **Response**: The `EmailAuth` concept was merged directly into `UserAuthentication`. This eliminates a separate concept and ensures `UserAuthentication` is complete in managing its entire lifecycle, including verification.

## Token example from pset:
## Exercise 2: Extending a familiar concept

In this exercise, you’ll complete the description of a familiar concept: authentication of users with passwords. You’ll also use this concept specification in the next exercise.

  **concept** PasswordAuthentication  
  **purpose** limit access to known users  
  **principle** after a user registers with a username and a password,  
    they can authenticate with that same username and password  
    and be treated each time as the same user  
  **state**  
    a set of Users with …  
  **actions**  
    register (username: String, password: String): (user: User)  
      …  
    authenticate (username: String, password: String): (user: User)  
      …

### Questions

1. Complete the definition of the concept state.
2. Write a requires/effects specification for each of the two actions. (_Hints_: The register action creates and returns a new user. The authenticate action is primarily a guard, and doesn’t mutate the state.)
3. What essential invariant must hold on the state? How is it preserved?
4. One widely used extension of this concept requires that registration be confirmed by email. Extend the concept to include this functionality. (_Hints_: you should add (1) an extra result variable to the register action that returns a secret token that (via a sync) will be emailed to the user; (2) a new confirm action that takes a username and a secret token and completes the registration; (3) whatever additional state is needed to support this behavior.)

**Deliverables**: Succinct answers to each of the questions with the required additional specification fragments.

## Exercise 3: Comparing concepts

One way to improve your understanding of concept design is to compare related concepts, and try to determine (and then articulate) how and why they differ. Confusion between related concepts can be a design flaw in itself, when the designer fails to convey (through the user interface and support materials) what concept is being offered in a particular situation.

> For example, X/Twitter used to have a feature called “favorites,” but it wasn’t clear if this was an instance of an Upvoting concept (which collected votes from users for popularity ranking) or a Favoriting (or Bookmarking) concept (which let users save favorite tweets). In 2015, Twitter renamed “favorites” to “likes” and replaced the yellow star icon with a red heart, explaining in a press release “We are changing our star icon for favorites to a heart and we’ll be calling them likes… We know that at times the star could be confusing, especially to newcomers. You might like a lot of things, but not everything can be your favorite.” Needless to say, this didn’t help explain what concept was actually at play, and in 2017, Melania Trump famously “liked” a tweet that taunted her husband, presumably believing that she was bookmarking it, when in fact her “like” was shown publicly as a gesture of approval. In 2018, Twitter finally added a Bookmark concept.

> In this case, it seems possible that the confusion was intentional, since public likes, unlike private bookmarks, serve the company’s business goals of increasing visible user engagement (and indeed, even after they were added, the bookmarking actions were buried in the user interface and far harder to access than the upvoting actions). In other cases, confusion between concepts is simply a consequence of poor design, and even with good design it is not possible to ensure complete clarity for all users given their diversity of background and assumptions.

### Passwords vs. Personal Access Tokens

GitHub offers a form of authentication called [personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens). This is described as “an alternative to using passwords.” [Creating a token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) sounds very much like creating a password with a strong password helper: you click a button to create a token, and get an obscure string which you can then save. [Using a token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#using-a-personal-access-token-on-the-command-line) appears to be the same as using a password: you enter a username and the token string, and will then be authenticated if the string matches the one that was generated when the token was created. Moreover, at the very start of the [article](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) we are told “Treat your access tokens like passwords.”

So what exactly is the difference between the standard _PasswordAuthentication_ concept and the _PersonalAccessToken_ concept? Read the Github page carefully, and write a minimal specification of the _PersonalAccessToken_ concept, paying particular attention to the purposes and operational principle. Now consider how the two concepts differ. Finally, say briefly whether you think the GitHub page could be improved, and if so how.

_Note_: consider only “personal access tokens (classic)” and not “fine-grained personal access tokens.”

**Deliverables**: a concept specification for _PersonalAccessToken_ and a succinct note about how it differs from _PasswordAuthentication_ and how you might change the GitHub documentation to explain this.

# UserAuthentication — Design Changes & Issues

This document outlines the evolution of the `UserAuthentication` concept from its initial representations in Assignment 2 (`User` and `EmailAuth`) to its current, consolidated form. It details the reasoning behind these changes, connecting them directly to the feedback received and broader concept design principles.

## Summary of Changes

The primary change is the **consolidation of user account management and email verification functionality** into a single `UserAuthentication` concept.

Key specific changes include:

1.  **Consolidated Authentication and Verification**: Merged the authentication-related aspects of the original `User` concept with the `EmailAuth` concept. The new `UserAuthentication` now internally manages user identity (via a generic `User` type parameter `[User]`), account credentials, and the full email verification lifecycle. It no longer includes non-authentication-specific user attributes like `firstName` or `lastName`.
2.  **Refined Status Model**: The `status` for `UserAccounts` evolved to `UNVERIFIED`, `VERIFIED`, `DEACTIVATED`, explicitly dictating that only `VERIFIED` users can `login`.
3.  **Integrated Email Verification**: All aspects of email verification (code generation, expiry, matching, and account status update) are now internal to `UserAuthentication`, including the `VerificationCodes` state and associated actions.
4.  **Password Hashing**: Includes `passwordHashed` in state for security.
5.  **Explicit Error Handling**: Actions define explicit success (`(user: User)`) and error (`(error: String)`) return signatures.
6.  **Reactivation Flow**: A deactivated user reactivates to an `UNVERIFIED` state, requiring re-verification.
7.  **System Cleanup Action**: Introduced `system cleanExpiredCodes` to manage expired verification codes.

## Rationale (Connect to Feedback)

The changes were directly inspired by the Assignment 2 feedback, which highlighted issues with modularity, separation of concerns, and concept independence:

*   **"User is a generic type and extremely standard, so in the future no need to define it unless there is really special functionality for your app."**
    *   **Response**: By using a generic `User` type `[User]` and shedding non-authentication attributes (e.g., `firstName`, `lastName`), `UserAuthentication` now strictly focuses on authentication-related data (`email`, `passwordHashed`, `status`). This directly addresses the feedback by making the concept more generic, reusable, and aligned with the "small and specific set of info and actions" principle, deferring broader user profile details to other concepts.

*   **"Typically email auth is also not its own concept (remember the token example from the psets?)."**
    *   **Response**: The feedback correctly identified that `EmailAuth` was not a truly independent, user-facing concept. Similar to the pset's Exercise 2, which demonstrated extending `PasswordAuthentication` to include token-based email confirmation *within* the same concept, `EmailAuth` functions as a *mechanism* or *internal process* to fulfill the larger purpose of `UserAuthentication` (account verification). It lacks a distinct "well-defined and intelligible purpose" that stands alone from managing user accounts and credentials. Merging `EmailAuth` into `UserAuthentication` ensures the latter is complete in managing its entire authentication lifecycle, including necessary verification steps, without relying on a separate, dependent concept. This reduces conceptual fragmentation and tightens the focus on authentication as a single, modular unit.

*   **"We want to maintain modularity and separation of concerns such that each concept handles only a very small and specific set of info and actions..."**
    *   **Response**: Consolidating `User`'s authentication concerns with `EmailAuth` allowed `UserAuthentication` to become a cohesive, self-contained unit. It now *solely* handles account creation, credential management, and email verification, creating a clear boundary from other user-related functionality (e.g., profiles, roles). This significantly enhances modularity and the separation of concerns, as each concept now addresses a truly distinct aspect.

## Design Decisions

1.  **Merging `EmailAuth` into `UserAuthentication`**:
    *   **Why**: The `EmailAuth` concept lacked true independence, acting more as an internal mechanism for account activation rather than a standalone user-facing service. Similar to how the psets illustrated extending `PasswordAuthentication` with an internal token-based confirmation, `EmailAuth`'s functionality is inherently part of the authentication process. Merging it ensures `UserAuthentication` provides *complete functionality* for its domain (authentication) by encapsulating the entire account lifecycle, including verification. This removes the prior problematic coupling and aligns with the concept design principle of independence and completeness.
    *   **Result**: `VerificationCodes` state and all email verification actions (`sendVerificationCode`, `verifyCode`, `revokeVerification`) are now internal to `UserAuthentication`, streamlining the authentication flow and eliminating cross-concept dependencies for this core functionality.

2.  **Refined Status Model (`UNVERIFIED`, `VERIFIED`, `DEACTIVATED`)**:
    *   **Why**: The `PENDING`/`REGISTERED` distinction in the original `User` concept was ambiguous regarding login eligibility. The new model clearly defines `VERIFIED` as the explicit prerequisite for `login`, providing a more precise and robust state machine for account activation and security. The `DEACTIVATED` state ensures accounts are marked as unusable until explicit reactivation.
    *   **Result**: Enhanced clarity in user lifecycle management and improved security (e.g., an unverified user cannot log in).

3.  **Use of Generic `User` Type**:
    *   **Why**: To prevent `UserAuthentication` from becoming a monolithic "God object" handling all aspects of a "user." By accepting a generic `User` type parameter, `UserAuthentication` focuses purely on *authenticating* an identity, without conflating it with profile details (e.g., `firstName`, `lastName`) or other attributes. This promotes reusability across diverse applications.
    *   **Result**: `UserAuthentication` is more focused, adheres better to separation of concerns, and is more reusable. Other concepts (e.g., `UserProfile`, `UserRoles`) would manage other aspects of a user, using synchronizations to coordinate with `UserAuthentication` as needed.

## Issues Encountered

1.  **Status Model Complexity (Trade-off)**: The `DEACTIVATED` state currently requires reactivation to an `UNVERIFIED` status, necessitating re-verification. This prioritizes security (re-establishing email ownership after inactivity) over potential user experience friction, a deliberate trade-off. An alternative allowing direct return to `VERIFIED` was considered but deemed less secure.

2.  **Code Expiry and Cleanup**: The `system cleanExpiredCodes` action, necessary for managing `VerificationCodes` expiry, implies an external operational dependency (e.g., a background job). While crucial for state management, it's an implementation detail that needs consideration beyond the concept definition.

3.  **Definition of "User" Across Concepts (Ongoing Consideration)**: While `UserAuthentication` uses a generic `User` type for modularity, defining a comprehensive "User" across an application requires coordinating information from various specialized concepts (e.g., `UserProfile`, `UserSettings`) via syncs. This is a positive trade-off for concept independence but necessitates careful orchestration for a complete user view.

These changes collectively enhance the clarity, modularity, and reusability of `UserAuthentication`, making it a more robust and compliant concept design in line with the specified principles.

5.  **Password Hashing**: Explicitly includes `passwordHashed` in state for security.
6.  **Explicit Error Handling**: Actions define explicit success (`(user: User)`) and error (`(error: String)`) return signatures.
7.  **Reactivation Flow**: A deactivated user reactivates to an `UNVERIFIED` state, requiring re-verification.
8.  **System Cleanup Action**: Introduced `system cleanExpiredCodes` to manage expired verification codes.

## Explaining Changes, Design Decisions, and Rationale

The design of `UserAuthentication` was significantly refined based on Assignment 2 feedback, focusing on modularity, separation of concerns, and concept independence.

### Consolidation of Authentication Logic (User & EmailAuth)

*   **Change**: The authentication-specific responsibilities of the original `User` concept and the entirety of the `EmailAuth` concept were merged into `UserAuthentication`. This concept now internally manages user identity (via a generic `User` type), account credentials, and the full email verification lifecycle. Non-authentication-specific user attributes like `firstName` or `lastName` have been removed.
*   **Rationale & Feedback**: This directly addresses the feedback, "Typically email auth is also not its own concept (remember the token example from the psets?)." In Assignment 2's Exercise 2, `PasswordAuthentication` was extended to include token-based email confirmation *within* the same concept. Similarly, `EmailAuth`'s functionality serves as an *internal mechanism* for `UserAuthentication`'s purpose (account verification), rather than a standalone, user-facing concept. Its state (`VerificationCodes`) and actions (`sendVerificationCode`, `verifyCode`) are intrinsically tied to the user account's lifecycle and status. By consolidating, `UserAuthentication` achieves *completeness of functionality* for its domain by encapsulating the entire account lifecycle, from registration to verification and login. This eliminates a problematic cross-concept dependency, improving *concept independence* and ensuring all authentication-related logic resides in one cohesive unit, thereby enhancing *separation of concerns*.

### Generic User Identity & Refined Status Model

*   **Change**: `UserAuthentication` now employs a generic `User` type parameter (`[User]`) and features a refined `status` model for `UserAccounts` (`UNVERIFIED`, `VERIFIED`, `DEACTIVATED`).
*   **Rationale & Feedback**: This addresses the feedback, "User is a generic type and extremely standard... no need to define it unless there is really special functionality for your app." By using a generic `User` type and removing attributes like `firstName` or `lastName`, `UserAuthentication` strictly focuses on *authenticating* an identity, not defining a comprehensive user profile. This significantly improves its *modularity* and *reusability*. The `UNVERIFIED`/`VERIFIED`/`DEACTIVATED` status model provides a clear, robust state machine, explicitly linking `VERIFIED` status to `login` eligibility, enhancing both clarity and security. Other user attributes are now appropriately deferred to separate, specialized concepts (e.g., `UserProfile`), promoting better *separation of concerns*.

### Enhanced Security and Clarity

*   **Changes**: `UserAuthentication` now explicitly includes `passwordHashed` in its state, defines distinct return signatures for success and error in actions like `registerUser` and `login`, implements a reactivation flow that returns accounts to `UNVERIFIED` status, and includes a `system cleanExpiredCodes` action.
*   **Rationale**: These additions collectively bolster security practices, provide clearer API contracts for developers, and define a complete, predictable lifecycle for user accounts. The `system cleanExpiredCodes` action specifically manages the transient state of verification codes, contributing to the concept's overall robustness.

## Issues Encountered

1.  **Status Model Complexity (Trade-off)**: The `DEACTIVATED` state currently requires reactivation to an `UNVERIFIED` status, necessitating re-verification. This design prioritizes security (re-establishing email ownership after potential inactivity) over user experience friction. An alternative allowing direct return to `VERIFIED` was considered but deemed less secure.
2.  **Code Expiry and Cleanup**: The `system cleanExpiredCodes` action, while crucial for managing expired `VerificationCodes`, implies an external operational dependency (e.g., a background job or cron service). This is an implementation detail that needs consideration beyond the concept definition itself.
3.  **Definition of "User" Across Concepts (Ongoing Consideration)**: While `UserAuthentication` effectively uses a generic `User` type for modularity, defining a comprehensive "User" experience across an application requires coordinating information from various specialized concepts (e.g., `UserProfile`, `UserSettings`) via synchronizations. This is a positive trade-off for concept independence but necessitates careful orchestration for a complete user view.

These changes collectively enhance the clarity, modularity, and reusability of `UserAuthentication`, making it a more robust and compliant concept design in line with the specified principles.
